# KISTI UltraScaleAI EnvPipe

EnvPipe (Envelope + Pipeline Parallelism) is an energy-efficient DNN training framework designed to reduce energy consumption while maintaining minimal performance impact. This project aims to address the high energy demands and sustainability challenges associated with scaling large language models (LLMs). By leveraging slack time created by bubbles in pipeline parallelism, EnvPipe strategically schedules pipeline units and dynamically adjusts SM frequency, enabling energy savings without compromising training accuracy or hyperparameters.

### Enhancements in This Version
This improved implementation of EnvPipe builds upon the [original EnvPipe repository](https://github.com/casys-kaist/EnvPipe) with the following updates:
- **LLama Model Support**: Enhanced compatibility with the Llama model family.
- **DeepSpeed Upgrade**: Updated for compatibility with the latest DeepSpeed library (v0.15.4).
- **Huggingface Integration**: Refactored code to seamlessly support Huggingface models, incorporating updates based on the [Transpeeder](https://github.com/HuangLK/transpeeder) repository for Llama model compatibility. If a Huggingface model can run with DeepSpeed's pipeline parallelism, it is compatible with EnvPipe.
- **Code Refactoring**: Improved code structure for better compatibility and maintainability.
- **Improved P2P Communication**: Redesigned the activation and gradient transfer mechanism to ensure deadlock-free execution aligned with EnvPipe's scheduling method. This improvement resolves the reliance on increased `NCCL_BUFFSIZE` for non-blocking communication, which is not guaranteed as clarified [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl/issues/1252#issuecomment-2058458352).

| **Parameter** | **Inputs** | **Explanation** |
|---|---|---|
| ENVPIPE_TYPE | baseline | Run all GPUs with maximum SM frequency. |
|  | uniform | Run all GPUs with optimal SM frequency that represents the minimum point in the energy valley curve. |
|  | envelope | Run pipeline units with optimal SM frequency that are inside the outer envelope. |

Hereâ€™s an example of how to run the script:

```bash
./train_llama_deepspeed.sh --type envelope --scheduling ours --reconfig balanced --gpus 0,1,3
```

## Add New GPU Architecture

EnvPipe supports the following GPU architectures by default: **V100**, **RTX3090**, **A100**, and **A6000**. To extend support to a new GPU architecture, you need to configure its supported clock frequencies, granularity parameters, and update specific parts of the codebase.

---

### Steps to Add a New GPU Architecture

#### 1. **Check Supported Clock Frequencies**
Determine the clock frequencies supported by your GPU architecture to ensure compatibility. Use the provided script:

```bash
python benchmarks/examples/scripts/get_supported_clock_frequencies.py
```

This script lists the available frequencies for your GPU. Profiling all frequencies can be time-consuming, so you will define a specific range with an appropriate granularity for efficiency.

---

#### 2. **Define the New GPU Architecture**
Add the new GPU architecture and its associated clock frequency parameters to the configuration file.

- Open `deepspeed/runtime/constants.py`.
- Append your new GPU architecture with the following parameters:

  - **`FILTER_MAX` and `FILTER_MIN`**: Define the range of SM frequencies for profiling. This restricts the profiling process to avoid testing unnecessary frequencies, reducing profiling time.
  - **`GRANULARITY`**: Specifies the step size between consecutive SM frequencies for profiling.
  - **`RECONFIGURE_GRANULARITY`**: Defines the minimum step size for frequency adjustment during runtime reconfiguration.

Example:

```python
# Add your new GPU architecture name
ENVPIPE_GPU_NEWARCH = 'newarch'

# Define clock frequency parameters for the new GPU
NEWARCH_SM_FREQ_FILTER_MAX = 1800  # Maximum profiled SM frequency (MHz)
NEWARCH_SM_FREQ_FILTER_MIN = 900   # Minimum profiled SM frequency (MHz)
NEWARCH_SM_FREQ_GRANULARITY = 90   # Step size for profiling SM frequency (MHz)
NEWARCH_RECONFIGURE_GRANULARITY = 30  # Minimum step size for runtime reconfiguration (MHz)
```

---

#### 3. **Update the Profiling Logic**
Add the new GPU parameters to the profiling logic in `EnvPipe/DeepSpeed/deepspeed/profiling/energy_profiler/profiler.py`.

This ensures that profiling respects the frequency constraints and granularity defined for the new GPU architecture:

```python
elif self.config["gpu"] == ENVPIPE_GPU_NEWARCH:
    sm_freq_filter_max = NEWARCH_SM_FREQ_FILTER_MAX
    sm_freq_filter_min = NEWARCH_SM_FREQ_FILTER_MIN
    sm_freq_granularity = NEWARCH_SM_FREQ_GRANULARITY
```

---

#### 4. **Update the Reconfiguration Logic**
In `EnvPipe/DeepSpeed/deepspeed/runtime/pipe/reconfiguration.py`, incorporate the reconfiguration granularity for the new GPU to adjust SM frequencies dynamically during runtime:

```python
elif self.config["gpu"] == ENVPIPE_GPU_NEWARCH:
    reconfigure_granularity = NEWARCH_RECONFIGURE_GRANULARITY
```

---

### Explanation of Parameters

| **Parameter**               | **Description**                                                                 |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`*_SM_FREQ_FILTER_MAX`**   | Maximum SM frequency (in MHz) to consider during profiling.                     |
| **`*_SM_FREQ_FILTER_MIN`**   | Minimum SM frequency (in MHz) to consider during profiling.                     |
| **`*_SM_FREQ_GRANULARITY`**  | Step size for SM frequency adjustments during profiling.                        |
| **`*_RECONFIGURE_GRANULARITY`** | Minimum step size for SM frequency reconfiguration during runtime adjustments. |

---

By following these steps, you can extend EnvPipe to support additional GPU architectures while maintaining efficient profiling and runtime reconfiguration.
